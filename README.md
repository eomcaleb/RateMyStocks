# RateMyStonks
Portfolio Ranking Software that displays different portfolio of stonks.
RMS algorithm ranks porfolio by few criterias: i) ROI, ii) duration of holding, iii) portfolio size, and more.

## How Does The Point System Work?
Every ape starts with the same number of money. So I don't want to hear about income inequality and lack of opportunities.
If your stonks goes to the moon, so do your points. If your stonks dip, so do your points.
The dashboard gives you an birds-eye-view of what your holdings are as well as other stonks you want to see.

## Why should I use RateMyStonks?
